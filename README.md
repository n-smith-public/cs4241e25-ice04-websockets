This was made completely by me.

This application is a simple chat app, with users able to create rooms for themselves and their friends to join using a simple 4-digit unique pin number. The creator of the chat has "Admin", which allows for some simple changes such as setting a filter level (no filter, banning common swears, banning common slurs, or banning both), as well as deleting messages and kicking members from the chat.

Honestly, the biggest challenge was more trying to figure out how to extrapolate the CSS into separate files than anything to do with Webhooks. Once I got the basics down, it was pretty easy to figure out from there, but it did take me probably around an hour to figure out why the CSS was not loading on the pages when I called it like you would in a traditional HTML file (<script src="xyx"></script>).
