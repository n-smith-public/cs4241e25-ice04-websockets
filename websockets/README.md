# ICE 04: Websockets

In this activity, you will work to build a simple websockets application

### Instructions

1. Decide whether you want to work alone or with others in this ISP. If you are working with others, make sure to list all of your group members in your README.

2. Implement the basic websockets setup demo from the [sockets guide](https://github.com/jmcuneo/cs4241-guides/blob/master/using.sockets.md). Make sure that is up and running correctly before proceeding to the next step.

3. Using the demo as a starting point, create a simple networked web application. Make sure the application can handle more than one person. If you're completing this assignment by yourself, find a friend to test it with you, or try to connect from a second computer.

4. Write up a README file that includes the names of all of your group members and a description of what the application does. Be sure to list anything a user might need to know before using your application. Also describe any challenges you faced.

5. Submit your final assignment by initiating a pull request against this repo.

**NOTE:** The demo uses Svelte, but you are welcome to switch to a different UI framework if you prefer.

## Members
This was made completely by me.

This application is a simple chat app, with users able to create rooms for themselves and their friends to join using a simple 4-digit unique pin number. The creator of the chat has "Admin", which allows for some simple changes such as setting a filter level (no filter, banning common swears, banning common slurs, or banning both), as well as deleting messages and kicking members from the chat.
